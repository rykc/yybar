            <p>I. Foreword</p>

            <p>
            1. Today I present the third Policy Address in my term
            of office. Right in the middle of the term of the current
            Government, this Policy Address originally aimed to review
            the progress made by the Government in the past and outline
            the focus of our future work. I have therefore decided earlier
            that I would deliver a more focused Policy Address in full this
            year, and compile a new document entitled Policy Address
            Supplement to comprehensively account for the work progress
            and commitments of the current‑term Government. Although
            Hong Kong has been undergoing unprecedented unrest in the
            past four months, I have chosen to present this Policy Address
            on the scheduled date as planned, and accordingly held over
            50 consultation sessions, with a view to responding to the
            aspirations of the community.
            </p><p>
            2. Hong Kong has always been one of the safest cities in
            the world, and being civilised, law‑abiding, free, pluralistic
            and inclusive, and paying mutual respect are the characteristics
            that this Asia’s world city takes pride in. Yet in just a few
            months, the areas affected by the social conflict arising from
            opposition to the Government’s amendment of the Fugitive
            Offenders Ordinance have become more extensive. Over 400
            demonstrations, processions and rallies took place in various
            districts in the past four months, and more often than not, they
            ended up in violent protests, causing injuries to more than
            1 100 people and the arrest of over 2 200. A handful of rioters
            initiated attacks and sabotages in an organised and planned
            manner. They doxxed and beat people holding different views,
            spreading chaos and fear in Hong Kong and seriously disrupting
            people’s daily lives. Employees of all trades and sectors, as well
            as small, medium and large businesses alike are deeply worried about the prospect of Hong Kong. People are asking: will
            Hong Kong return to normal? Is Hong Kong still a place we can
            live in peace?
            </p><p>
            3. Many sectors of our society have condemned the radical
            acts of rioters and supported the Government to strictly enforce
            the law to end violence. Various sectors have appealed to people
            with different political views to put aside differences, stop
            violence as soon as possible and restore calm in society. Apart
            from curbing illegal acts, supporting law enforcement by the
            Police Force and ensuring that government departments and
            public organisations will make full effort to reduce the impact
            on citizens, the Government strives to pursue other courses
            of action with a view to getting out of this impasse together
            with the community. More than a month ago, I announced
            the introduction of four actions, which included launching a
            diversified dialogue platform with a view to finding a way out
            for Hong Kong. The Policy Address delivered today outlines
            various measures to deal with issues of greatest public concern.
            Later, I will invite community leaders, experts and academics to
            conduct an in‑depth and independent examination of the social
            conflicts in Hong Kong and the deep‑seated problems that must
            be addressed.
            </p><p>
            4. I will adhere to the following principles, be it in
            handling the current major crisis or continuing to discharge
            our governance responsibilities. First, we will adhere to
            “One Country, Two Systems” and safeguard the rights and
            freedoms protected by the Basic Law. However, any acts that
            advocate Hong Kong’s independence and threaten the country’s
            sovereignty, security and development interests will not be
            tolerated. In the 22 years since Hong Kong returned to the
            Motherland, “One Country, Two Systems” has proven to be the
            best system for ensuring the long‑term prosperity and stability
            of Hong Kong. Our national leaders have made it clear on
            many occasions that “One Country, Two Systems” is a long‑term national strategy in line with the fundamental interests of our
            country. The successful implementation of “One Country,
            Two Systems” is the common aspiration of our country, Hong
            Kong and people of the two places. Despite the stormy times
            and overwhelming difficulties Hong Kong is experiencing, I
            believe that so long as we accurately adhere to the principle of
            “One Country, Two Systems”, we will be able to get out of the
            impasse.
            </p><p>
            5. Second, the rule of law, which is the cornerstone of our
            success, is a core value of paramount importance to Hong Kong.
            We must make every effort to safeguard the rule of law. As the
            integral components of the rule of law, a law‑abiding population,
            strict and impartial enforcement of the laws, independent
            prosecutorial power and judicial independence must be
            respected by all and not be undermined.
            </p><p>
            6. Third, Hong Kong’s institutional strengths are built up
            over time by different bodies and organisations including the
            executive authorities, the legislature, the judiciary, the civil
            service, law enforcement and regulatory agencies, public service
            bodies, media organisations, etc. Each and every one of us has
            the responsibility to protect these strengths and prevent them
            from being eroded. I would like to take this opportunity to
            thank everyone who has stood fast in their positions during the
            confrontations in recent months, including staff members of
            various organisations, in particular police officers, staff of the
            MTR Corporation Limited and Airport Authority, maintenance
            and cleaning workers, as well as numerous Hong Kong
            citizens who silently stand guard over Hong Kong. With
            their contributions and hard work, Hong Kong is able to keep
            functioning.
            </p><p>
            7. Being an open and free city, Hong Kong has always
            upheld the principles of inclusiveness, integration and mutual
            respect, and has been resolving disputes by peaceful and rational means. Owing to our adherence to these values, Hong Kong
            has won recognition and respect in the international community.
            While we respect different opinions and understand people’s
            enthusiasm in fighting for justice and rights, I believe our society
            will agree that continued violence and spread of hatred would
            erode the core values of Hong Kong, disrupt social peace and
            undermine the excellent systems that took years of efforts to
            build. I therefore appeal to every Hong Kong citizen to cherish
            the city in which we all have a share and to safeguard the core
            values we uphold so that Hong Kong can return to calmness.
            </p><p>
            8. Although we have not had enough time to prepare
            for this year’s Policy Address, we still manage to put forward
            over 220 new initiatives, albeit some are in the form of policy
            directions or possible options. We stand ready to listen to
            people’s views and to enrich or adjust the contents and details of
            our policies.
            </p><p>
            9. Moreover, in view of the social situation this year,
            we adopt the approach of launching initiatives once they
            are ready, be it providing support to alleviate the impact of
            economic downturn or improving people’s livelihood further.
            The Financial Secretary has announced in August and September
            a series of measures to support enterprises, safeguard jobs and
            relieve people’s financial burden. The relevant Directors of
            Bureaux have also announced in advance of the Policy Address
            various new measures, including enhancing child care services,
            supporting sports development, enhancing financial support
            to help owners maintain their old buildings, strengthening
            response measures against influenza and providing subsidies for
            the installation of electric vehicle charging facilities in private
            buildings. As such, I will only focus on four aspects of work,
            namely housing, land supply, improving people’s livelihood and
            economic development.
